Community-Bubbles-Macros
========================

Some half-baken user macros to replace often used Community Bubbles (Adaptavist Confluence Plugin) pendants.

As [Adaptavist](http://www.adaptavist.com/) retired Community Bubbles [and a bunch of more plugins](http://www.adaptavist.com/w/announcement-retirement-11-add-ons/) we (the users) are left with a lot of migration efforts in our systems. This repo is an attempt to make some of the often used macros from Community Bubbles available as semantically identical user macros. That way we hope to reduce the effort for migrating a lot of pages...

Macros to be covered:

* user-info
* my-favourite-pages
* community-summary
* ...
